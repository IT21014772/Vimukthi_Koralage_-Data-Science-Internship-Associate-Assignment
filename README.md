**Task 1**
For task 1 I have added 2 files, first the preprocessing of the given datasets are done in the Preprocessing_Task1.ipynb file, then a business solution is created as a streamlit application in the business_solution_Task1.ipynb file.

**To execute the business solution **
  download the processed_sales_data.csv
  install the necessary python packages to execute the streamlit application (run pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn in terminal)
  run the code in business_solution_Task1.ipynb using a python IDE(eg: PyCharm)
  when the UI of the application loads upload the downloaded processed_sales_data.csv
  view and interact with the solution
